# Ken Courtney | UX Design Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal UX design portfolio. It's a static site built with Eleventy, showcasing a collection of my case studies and professional work.

## About The Project

As a UX designer with a background in front-end development, I wanted to build my portfolio from scratch to have full control over the design and user experience. This project demonstrates my skills not only in UX design but also in building a responsive, accessible, and performant web application.

## Technologies Used

*   **[Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/):** A simple static site generator.
*   **[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/):** The templating language used for the layouts.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and styling, using modern features like CSS Custom Properties, Flexbox, and Grid.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements like the navigation, carousels, and sticky tabs.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate into the project directory.**
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The site will then be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

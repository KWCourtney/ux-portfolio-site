  <h3>My Path to UX</h3>
  <p>I've worked across just about every type of team from startups, agencies, global NGOs, and enterprise SaaS.  That range is a big part of what shapes how I work today.</p>
  <p>I started out at a small startup where I wore every hat -- designer, developer, project manager. That experience gave me a deep respect for getting things out the door, and an instinct for knowing when "good enough" is truly enough. From there I went to <strong class="metric-highlight">Digitas</strong>, where I got my first exposure to large-scale digital production, working alongside high-caliber UX teams and devs.</p>
  <p>After that, I freelanced for a few years designing and building e-commerce sites, brand platforms, and internal tools. Running my own business taught me how to prioritize fast, make tradeoffs, and stay hands-on across design and front-end implementation.</p>
  <p>In 2009, I joined the <strong class="metric-highlight">United Nations (UNICEF)</strong> as a front-end developer. I worked with global product owners and UI designers to build SharePoint-based intranet tools for field staff around the world. The work was high-visibility, well-resourced, and focused on utility giving me a crash course in accessible, global-first design.</p>
  <p>From there, I moved into a hybrid UX + front-end role at <strong class="metric-highlight">BBDO</strong>, where I spent 8 years designing internal platforms for clients like <strong class="metric-highlight">Mercedes</strong> and <strong class="metric-highlight">Johnson & Johnson</strong>. I redesigned their global timesheet app, increasing adoption by 35%, and led the streamlining of internal collaboration tools built in SharePoint and later in Angular.</p>
  <p>In 2021, I joined <strong class="metric-highlight">ORBCOMM</strong> as a Senior UX Designer and was promoted to UX Manager. I led major redesign efforts across their SaaS B2B transportation platform, built the company's first design system in XD and later oversaw a project to port that design system to Figma, and created a full onboarding process map that uncovered key bottlenecks and unlocked a strategic roadmap projected to eliminate over 12,000 days of customer onboarding delay. I also modernized our UI layer using CSS-only skinning, giving the platform a facelift without the cost of a full rebuild.</p>

  <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
  <p>What pulled me toward UX in the first place was the problem-solving. In development, I was often handed a solution and asked to build it. In design, I get to be part of defining the problem and shaping the solution from the ground up.</p>
  <p>I like being at the start of the process: figuring out what's broken, what users actually need, and what would make the experience simpler or smarter. It's creative, collaborative, and strategic, and that's what keeps me in it.</p>

  <h3>How I Work</h3>
  <p>I'm a strong collaborator and a natural translator between design, development, and business. I listen well, whether I'm talking to users, product managers, or engineers, and I ask the right questions to uncover what's really going on.</p>
  <p>That ability to build trust and get clarity across disciplines has been just as important to my UX work as design tools or research methods. I don't just design for people: I work closely with them to make the right things happen.</p>

  <h3>Today</h3>
  <p>I specialize in simplifying complex enterprise workflows, bridging the gap between design and development, and leading UX strategy for high-impact digital products. Whether it's cleaning up an onboarding flow or overhauling a legacy UI, I bring a pragmatic, systems-focused approach to design backed by years of hands-on experience.</p>

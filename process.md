  <h1 class="page-title">My UX Process</h1>
  <p class="page-subtext">
    My approach to UX design is rooted in understanding and solving real-world user and business challenges. It's cyclical and iterative, shifting focus based on project needs, business priorities, and user feedback. These activity areas often overlap, repeat, or run in parallel to deliver the best results.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Discovery and Research</h3>
            <p>
            Immersing in the user's world, their tasks, environments, and goals, to uncover needs, constraints, and opportunities. Methods such as interviews, journey mapping, UX audits, and analytics reviews are chosen to fit the project's unique context. Discovery can be foundational at the start or revisited when new questions arise.

            <p>
            <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Mapping ORBCOMM's 80+ step onboarding flow uncovered the root causes of onboarding delays, <strong class="metric-highlight">eliminating over 12K annual delay days</strong> and <strong class="metric-highlight">8.5K+ avoidable support cases</strong> in the strategic roadmap.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Definition and Alignment</h3>
            <p>
            Synthesizing insights into clear problem statements and measurable goals while aligning stakeholders early and often. Priorities can shift as new data emerges, sometimes leading back to additional research or ideation.
            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Reframing an ambiguous "provisioning UI" request into a coordinated, cross-team onboarding solution, aligning <strong class="metric-highlight">10+ departments</strong> on a single strategic plan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Ideation and Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>
            Exploring a range of solutions with product, engineering, and business partners. Ideation can occur at multiple points in the process, especially when new constraints or opportunities surface.
            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Evolving fleet dashboard concepts from static reports into dynamic, real-time operational views, increasing <strong class="metric-highlight">operational visibility</strong> and enabling <strong class="metric-highlight">faster response times</strong>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prototyping and Design</h3>
            <p>
                Turning concepts into tangible designs at the fidelity best suited for the stage and feedback goals. Prototyping often overlaps with testing, and using design system components ensures speed and consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Creating a guided alerts wizard that <strong class="metric-highlight">cut setup time by 50%</strong> and <strong class="metric-highlight">reduced user errors</strong> through inline validation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
            <p>
                Gathering feedback from users, stakeholders, and developers at multiple points in the process, not just after design. Testing cycles back into earlier activities to refine solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Iterating the alerts wizard until <strong class="metric-highlight">confidence scores improved by 85%</strong> in usability testing.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Implementation and Iteration</h3>
            <p>
            Partnering with developers to ensure design fidelity, supporting QA, and monitoring post-launch performance. Insights from live products feed back into discovery, design, and testing for continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
           <span class="header-outcome">Example and Outcome</span>Migrating ORBCOMM's design system to Figma, <strong class="metric-highlight">cutting rework by 40%</strong> and accelerating delivery velocity.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    This process flexes to the situation. A new product might require deep discovery, while an existing feature update might focus on rapid testing and iteration. Whatever the mix, it stays anchored in user insight, team alignment, and measurable results.
